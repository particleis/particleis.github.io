  <diagram>A cloud layer (the cloud) about 2/4 up with a mesh of particles activating above it. An amagomation which appears as a collection of API's, code, and other "garpage" taped or ties together into a ball. BAloons(or Dockr whales) lift the mess barely into the clouds. It appears unsteady and occasionaly falters somewhat.</diagram>
  <title>Now Vs. New</title>
  <description>Emerging standards like OpenStack and Docker attempt to modernize the antiquated, monolithic concept of applications. They still require countless layers of software, code, and human involvement to create, interconnect, and maintain systems.

  Particle is a new computing model â€” a modern perspective that completely separates a task from it's implementation in code and hardware. A single homogenous system for any problem or purpose with it's underlying implementation autonomously evolving using modern computer science & machine learning.
