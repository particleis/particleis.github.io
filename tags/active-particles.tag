  <diagram>Words describing a type of actions slides in frm the left. ie. Physics simulation. Halves of a particle come from the top and bottom, containing the centered text, and fuzing into a single particle. The particle begins to spin up and then slides out to the right. 12 types for each color would be ideal.</diagram>
